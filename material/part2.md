# Part 2: Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Computer vision is a field in computer science that aims to enable computers to "see" and interpret the visual world, much like humans do. Various algorithms, especially those based on machine learning and deep learning, help build models that can make predictions based on images or videos. This article focuses on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, a powerful type of supervised deep learning algorithm commonly used for image-related tasks.

A CNN is a specialized kind of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) designed primarily for processing grid-like data, such as images. The steps involved in building a CNN:

1.  **Image Channels:** Representing the image numerically.
2.  **Convolution:** Extracting features from the image.
3.  **Pooling:** Reducing the size and complexity of the features.
4.  **Flattening:** Preparing data for the final classification layers.
5.  **Full Connection:** Using standard neural network layers for classification.

Let's explore each step.

## 1. Image Channels

Before a CNN can process an image, the image must be converted into a numerical format. This is done using pixel values. Each pixel in an image represents a point of color and intensity.

*   **Grayscale Images:** For a black and white (grayscale) image, each pixel has a single value, typically ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). An image with height `m` and width `n` is represented as a 2-dimensional array (or matrix) of size `m x n`.
*   **Color Images:** Most color images use the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) model. Each pixel is represented by *three* values, one for the intensity of red, one for green, and one for blue (each usually 0-255). A color image of size `m x n` is represented as a 3-dimensional array of size `m x n x 3` (height x width x channels).

<!-- ![Image channel description](./img/image-channel.png) -->
<img src="./img/image-channel.png" width="50%">

The image is represented as a 3-dimensional array, with each channel representing red, green, and blue values, respectively, as shown in the following image featuring an apple.

<!-- ![apple channel](./img/apple-channel.jpg) -->

***
**Code Example: Image Channels (RGB)**

The following code snippet demonstrates how a small 3x3 pixel color image is represented as a NumPy array and how its individual Red, Green, and Blue channels can be separated:

```python
# Cell 1: Image Channels (RGB)
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulate a tiny 3x3 RGB image (values 0-255)
# Shape: (height, width, channels)
tiny_rgb_image = np.array([
    [[255, 0, 0], [0, 255, 0], [0, 0, 255]],      # Row 1: Red, Green, Blue pixels
    [[255, 255, 0], [255, 0, 255], [0, 255, 255]], # Row 2: Yellow, Magenta, Cyan
    [[255, 255, 255], [128, 128, 128], [0, 0, 0]]  # Row 3: White, Gray, Black
], dtype=np.uint8)

print("Original Image Shape (Height, Width, Channels):", tiny_rgb_image.shape)

# Extract channels (Slicing the last dimension)
red_channel = tiny_rgb_image[:, :, 0]   # Index 0
green_channel = tiny_rgb_image[:, :, 1] # Index 1
blue_channel = tiny_rgb_image[:, :, 2]  # Index 2

# Display the channels and the combined image
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(12, 3))
axs[0].imshow(red_channel, cmap='Reds_r'); axs[0].set_title('Red Channel'); axs[0].axis('off')
axs[1].imshow(green_channel, cmap='Greens_r'); axs[1].set_title('Green Channel'); axs[1].axis('off')
axs[2].imshow(blue_channel, cmap='Blues_r'); axs[2].set_title('Blue Channel'); axs[2].axis('off')
axs[3].imshow(tiny_rgb_image); axs[3].set_title('Combined RGB'); axs[3].axis('off')
plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()

# Print the numerical values
print("\nRed Channel Values:\n", red_channel)
print("\nGreen Channel Values:\n", green_channel)
print("\nBlue Channel Values:\n", blue_channel)
```


**Visualizing RGB Channels with an Online Tool**

To get a better visual intuition of how an image is split into its Red, Green, and Blue components, you can use online tools. These tools often display each channel as a separate grayscale image, where brighter areas indicate higher intensity of that specific color in the original image. This can help solidify the concept of channels representing different color information.

For example, you can upload [an image](./img/apple.jpg) to a site like [Online Image Color Channel Separator](https://onlinetools.com/image/separate-image-color-channels) to see this separation visually.

## 2. Convolution


### Inspiration from the Brain: Hierarchical Vision

Before diving into the mechanics of CNNs, it's helpful to understand their inspiration: the human visual system. Our brains don't process an entire scene instantly. Instead, visual information travels through different areas of the brain, particularly the visual cortex located in the occipital lobe, processing features in a hierarchical manner.

<img src="./img/v1.png" alt="Abstract illustration of visual areas in the human brain, showing Primary visual cortex (V1), V2, V3, and higher areas like Posterior parietal cortex and Inferior temporal cortex." width="50%">

> Image source: [Perkins School for the Blind, Adapted from Banich and Compton (2018)](https://www.perkins.org/higher-order-visual-pathways-and-the-cvi-brain/)

As shown in the illustration above:

1.  Information first hits the **Primary Visual Cortex (V1)**. Neurons here respond to simple features like edges, lines, and orientations.
2.  This output is passed to subsequent areas like **V2** and **V3**. Neurons in these areas combine the simple features detected in V1 to recognize more complex shapes, corners, and textures.
3.  Further processing in higher-level areas (like the Inferior Temporal Cortex, not fully detailed here) combines these shapes to recognize complex objects (like faces, chairs, or the apple from our earlier example).

<img src="./img/2b2.png" alt="" width="50%">


**The Connection to CNNs:**

Convolutional Neural Networks are designed to mimic this hierarchical feature learning. The **Convolutional layers** in a CNN act similarly to these stages in the visual cortex:

*   **Early convolutional layers** (closer to the input image) automatically learn to detect simple features like edges and corners.
*   **Deeper convolutional layers** (further into the network) receive input from earlier layers and learn to combine those simple features to detect more complex patterns, textures, parts of objects, and eventually entire objects.

This biological inspiration helps explain why CNNs are structured with multiple layers and why convolution is such a fundamental operation for image understanding. Now, let's look at how the convolution operation actually achieves this feature extraction.

### CNN

**Purpose:** Now that the image is represented numerically, the next step is to identify important visual features within it. Convolution is the core operation CNNs use for this feature extraction (e.g., finding edges, corners, textures).

Think of convolution like sliding a small specialized magnifying glass over the image. This "magnifying glass" is called a **filter** or **kernel**, and it's designed to detect a specific pattern. When the filter is over a part of the image that matches its pattern, it produces a strong signal (high value); otherwise, the signal is weak (low value). This process creates an output map, called a **feature map**, which highlights where the specific feature appears in the original image.

**Important Note:** While we often use simple, predefined filters (like edge detectors) for explanation, a key strength of CNNs is that they *learn* the optimal filter values during the training process based on the task (e.g., classifying cats vs. dogs).

### How Features are Detected

To extract features, we use a filter (kernel). The filter slides across the input image's numerical array. At each position, the filter's values are multiplied element-wise with the underlying patch of the image, and the results are summed up to produce a single value in the feature map.

<img src="./img/2b1.jpg" alt="" width="50%">

For simplicity, the following animation shows how an edge detector filter might be applied to just one channel (e.g., the blue channel) of an image. The resulting feature map highlights the edges found.

<!-- ![Animation showing how an edge detector filter is applied to the blue channel output.](./img/convolution.gif) -->
<img src="./img/convolution.gif" width="50%">

The filter used in the animation is size `3x3` applied to an input of size `5x5`. The resulting feature map is size `3x3`. In summary, for an input image of size `n x n` and a filter of size `m x m` (with stride 1, no padding), the resulting output is of size `(n - m + 1) x (n - m + 1)`.

***
**Code Example: Feature Detection (Single Filter Convolution)**

This code applies a 3x3 vertical edge detection filter to a 5x5 single-channel input, producing a 3x3 feature map.

<summary>Step 1/9: Setup (Loading a Real Image)</summary>

Let's load a real image from the web. We'll use a picture of a Pigeon. We will load it, convert it to RGB (just in case it's [RGBA](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_colors_rgb.asp) or other), resize it slightly for faster processing, and also create a grayscale version for single-channel demonstrations.

### Strided Convolutions

**Purpose:** Striding allows the filter to skip pixels as it slides across the input image, effectively downsampling the output. This reduces the size of the resulting feature map more significantly and speeds up computation.

**Process:** Instead of moving one pixel at a time (stride=1), the filter can jump, for example, 2 pixels (stride=2) horizontally and vertically.

The following animation shows the same convolution as before, but with a stride of 2 steps.

<!-- ![Stride](./img/stride2.gif) -->
<img src="./img/stride2.gif" width="50%">

The `3x3` filter applied to the `5x5` input with `stride=2` results in a `2x2` feature map. In summary, for an input `n x n`, filter `m x m`, and stride `k`, the output size is `floor((n - m) / k + 1) x floor((n - m) / k + 1)`.

***
**Code Example: Strided Convolution**

```python
# Cell 3: Striding on Real Image

# Check if image loading was successful
if 'img_gray' not in globals():
    print("Grayscale image not loaded. Please run the setup cell first.")
else:
    # Use grayscale image and horizontal edge filter this time
    input_image = img_gray
    filter_kernel = filter_horizontal # Let's use the horizontal one here

    # Manual convolution calculation with stride = 3 (more noticeable reduction)
    stride = 3
    input_h, input_w = input_image.shape
    filter_h, filter_w = filter_kernel.shape
    # Calculate output dimensions
    output_h = int(np.floor((input_h - filter_h) / stride)) + 1
    output_w = int(np.floor((input_w - filter_w) / stride)) + 1
    feature_map_strided = np.zeros((output_h, output_w), dtype=np.float32)

    # Perform the convolution manually stepping by 'stride'
    for i in range(output_h):
        for j in range(output_w):
            start_row, start_col = i * stride, j * stride
            patch = input_image[start_row : start_row + filter_h, start_col : start_col + filter_w]
            # Ensure patch dimensions match filter if near edge with stride
            if patch.shape == filter_kernel.shape:
                 feature_map_strided[i, j] = np.sum(patch * filter_kernel)

    print(f"Input Shape: {input_image.shape}, Filter Shape: {filter_kernel.shape}")

### Padding

**Purpose:** Convolution (especially without stride) reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature map. Also, pixels near the border of the image are processed fewer times by the filter than pixels in the center. **Padding** addresses these issues by:
1.  Allowing control over the output feature map size (e.g., keeping it the same as the input using "same" padding).
2.  Ensuring pixels at the edges and corners are processed more thoroughly by the filter.

**Process:** Padding involves adding extra rows and columns of zeros (usually) around the border of the input image *before* applying the convolution.

The following animation shows how 1 layer of zero-padding is added to the input array before the filter is applied.

<!-- ![Padding](./img/padding.gif) -->
<img src="./img/padding.gif" width="50%">

With one layer of padding (`p=1`), the `5x5` input becomes `7x7`. Applying a `3x3` filter (`m=3`) with `stride=1` then results in a `5x5` output, preserving the original spatial dimensions. In general, for input `n x n`, filter `m x m`, padding `p`, and stride `k=1`, the output size is `(n + 2p - m + 1) x (n + 2p - m + 1)`.

***
**Code Example: Padding**

This code adds `padding=1` before convolution to maintain the output size.

```python
# Cell 4: Padding on Real Image

# Check if image loading was successful
if 'img_gray' not in globals():
    print("Grayscale image not loaded. Please run the setup cell first.")
else:
    # Use grayscale image and the sharpen filter
    input_image = img_gray
    filter_kernel = filter_sharpen

    # Add padding (p=1 layer of zeros)
    padding = 1

### How Convolutions Apply over RGB Channels

**Process:** When dealing with color images (e.g., 3 channels: R, G, B), the convolution filter must also have the same number of channels (depth). So, if the input is `n x n x 3`, a `m x m` filter will actually be `m x m x 3`.

The 3D filter slides over the 3D input patch. The element-wise multiplication and summation happens across *all three channels simultaneously*. The crucial point is that all these results (from R, G, and B interactions with their respective filter channels) are summed up into a *single* number for that position in the output feature map. Therefore, even with a 3-channel input and a 3-channel filter, the resulting feature map is still **2-dimensional**.

<!-- ![RGB convolutions](./img/RGB_Convolutions.png) -->
<img src="./img/RGB_Convolutions.png" width="50%">

For a `5x5` image represented over 3 channels (`5x5x3` array), a `3x3` filter (represented as a `3x3x3` array) produces a single `4x4` feature map (assuming stride=1, no padding: `(5-3+1) = 3+1 = 4`).

***
**Code Example: Convolution over RGB Channels**

This code applies one 3x3x3 filter to a 5x5x3 input, producing a single 3x3 feature map (using stride=1 and 'valid'/no padding for simplicity).

### How Convolutions Apply with More Than One Filter

**Purpose:** A single filter detects only one feature type. CNNs use *multiple* filters in the same convolutional layer to learn a richer set of features simultaneously (e.g., vertical edges, horizontal edges, curves, textures).

**Process:** If a convolutional layer has `F` filters, each filter (size `m x m x C`) is applied independently to the input (`n x n x C`). This generates `F` separate 2D feature maps. These maps are then stacked together along the depth dimension, creating a final output volume of size `(n-m+1) x (n-m+1) x F` (assuming stride=1, no padding).

<!-- ![Filters](./img/Filters_Convolutions.png) -->
<img src="./img/Filters_Convolutions.png" width="50%">

The image shows applying three different filters to the RGB input. Each filter produces its own 2D feature map (size `4x4` in the example). Stacking these results produces a `4x4x3` output volume.

***
**Code Example: Convolution with Multiple Filters**

This code applies two different 3x3x3 filters to the 5x5x3 input, resulting in a 3x3x2 output volume (using stride=1, 'valid'/no padding).

```python

## 3. Pooling Layers

**Purpose:** After convolution extracts features, pooling layers (also called subsampling layers) reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the feature maps. This:
1.  Reduces the amount of computation and parameters.
2.  Helps make features more robust to small variations in their exact location (achieving some "translation invariance").

**Process:** Pooling operates on each feature map independently. A window slides over the feature map (often non-overlapping, e.g., 2x2 window with stride 2), and a summary statistic is computed. Common types are:
*   **Average Pooling:** Takes the average value within the window.
*   **Max Pooling:** Takes the maximum value within the window (most common).

<img src="./img/3b.jpg" alt="" width="50%">


The following animation shows Max Pooling with a 2x2 window and stride 2 (implied by non-overlapping movement). For every 2x2 group of cells, the maximum value is selected for the output. (Note: *the animation is not quite accurate*)

<!-- ![pooling](./img/pooling.gif) -->
<img src="./img/pooling.gif" width="50%">

Note that pooling is applied independently to each feature map generated by the preceding convolutional layer.

***
**Code Example: Max Pooling**

This code demonstrates Max Pooling with a 2x2 window and stride=2 on a 4x4 feature map, resulting in a 2x2 output.

```python
# Cell 7: Pooling Layers (Max Pooling)
# Example 4x4 feature map
feature_map = np.array([
    [12, 20, 30,  0], [ 8, 18,  2, 25], [15,  5, 22, 19], [21, 10,  9, 31]
], dtype=np.float32)
print("Original Feature Map (4x4):\n", feature_map)

# Apply Max Pooling (2x2 window, stride=2)
pool_size = 2; stride = 2
map_h, map_w = feature_map.shape
output_h = int(np.floor((map_h - pool_size) / stride)) + 1 # (4-2)/2 + 1 = 2
output_w = int(np.floor((map_w - pool_size) / stride)) + 1 # (4-2)/2 + 1 = 2
pooled_map = np.zeros((output_h, output_w), dtype=np.float32)

for i in range(output_h):
    for j in range(output_w):
        patch = feature_map[i*stride : i*stride + pool_size, j*stride : j*stride + pool_size]
        pooled_map[i, j] = np.max(patch)

print(f"\nMax Pooled Map ({output_h}x{output_w}):\n", pooled_map)

# Display
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7, 3.5))
def plot_matrix_pooling(ax, data, title): # Helper to show values
    im = ax.imshow(data, cmap='viridis'); ax.set_title(title)
    for r in range(data.shape[0]):
        for c in range(data.shape[1]):
            ax.text(c, r, f"{data[r, c]:.0f}", ha='center', va='center', color='white' if data[r,c] < 15 else 'black')

plot_matrix_pooling(axs[1], pooled_map, f'Max Pooled ({output_h}x{output_w})')
plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()
```


***

## 4. Flattening

**Purpose:** The convolutional and pooling layers output multi-dimensional feature maps (e.g., `Height x Width x Channels`). Standard Artificial Neural Network layers (Fully Connected/Dense layers), used for the final classification, expect their input as a single, flat **1-dimensional vector**. Flattening converts the multi-dimensional output into this required 1D format.

**Process:** Flattening simply takes all the elements in the multi-dimensional array and arranges them sequentially into one long vector.

<!-- ![Flattening](./img/flattening.gif) -->
<img src="./img/flattening.gif" width="50%">

The animation shows the transformation of the pooled feature maps (a 3D volume) into a single column (a 1D vector). Note that in practice, flattening is applied to the entire volume of feature maps resulting from the last conv/pool layer.

***
**Code Example: Flattening**

This code flattens a small 2x2x2 volume into a 1D vector of length 8.

```python
# Cell 8: Flattening
# Example 2x2x2 volume (e.g., output from pooling 2 feature maps)
pooled_output_multi_filter = np.array([
    [[40, 55], [75, 65]], # H=0, W=0, C=0,1 | H=0, W=1, C=0,1
    [[90, 85], [95, 70]]  # H=1, W=0, C=0,1 | H=1, W=1, C=0,1
], dtype=np.float32) # Shape is (H, W, C) = (2, 2, 2)

print("Input to Flattening (Pooled Feature Maps):")
print("Shape (H, W, C):", pooled_output_multi_filter.shape)
print("Data:\n", pooled_output_multi_filter)

# Flatten the 3D array into a 1D vector (C-style order: last axis changes fastest)
flattened_vector = pooled_output_multi_filter.flatten(order='C')

print("\nFlattened Vector:")
print("Shape:", flattened_vector.shape) # (2*2*2,) = (8,)
print("Data:", flattened_vector) # Order: (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,0), ...

# Visualization

## 5. Full Connection: A Simple Convolutional Network

**Purpose:** This is the final stage where the network performs classification. The flattened vector, containing extracted features, is fed into one or more standard **Fully Connected (Dense)** layers, similar to those in a basic ANN. These layers learn to combine the features to make a final prediction.

**Process:** The flattened vector is the input to the first Dense layer. Each neuron connects to all neurons in the previous layer. The last Dense layer typically has neurons equal to the number of classes (e.g., 10 for digits 0-9) and uses an activation like **Softmax** to output class probabilities.

A typical CNN architecture repeats Convolution and Pooling steps (Conv -> Pool -> Conv -> Pool -> ...) before Flattening and passing to the Fully Connected layers. The exact number of layers and their parameters depend on the specific task.

<!-- ![CNN FC](./img/CNN-Full-connection.png) -->
<img src="./img/CNN-Full-connection.png" width="50%">

The image above illustrates the end-to-end flow: an input image goes through Convolution and Pooling layers (possibly multiple times), the result is Flattened into a vector, and this vector feeds into Fully Connected (Dense) layers for final classification (e.g., predicting "apple").

***
**Code Example: Simplified CNN Flow (Conceptual)**

This code shows the conceptual flow from a tiny input through simplified Conv, ReLU, Pool, and Flatten steps, yielding the vector ready for the Dense layers.

## Putting it Together: An Example CNN Architecture

The individual steps (Convolution, Pooling, Flattening, Full Connection) are combined to form a complete CNN. The following diagram illustrates a typical architecture:

<img src="./img/cnn-architecture.jpg" alt="Diagram showing input image -> Conv -> Pool -> Conv -> Pool -> Flatten -> Dense -> Dense -> Output" width=auto>

This structure often involves stacking convolutional and pooling layers to progressively extract more complex features before flattening and passing the information to dense layers for classification.

Let's see how a similar architecture can be implemented using the Keras library in Python:

```python
# Import necessary Keras components
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

def create_cnn_model(input_shape=(32, 32, 3), num_classes=10):
    """Creates a simple CNN model using Keras."""
    model = Sequential([
        # First Convolutional Layer: Extracts initial features
        # 32 filters, each 3x3. 'relu' activation introduces non-linearity.
        # input_shape specifies (height, width, channels) for the first layer.
        Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),

        # First Pooling Layer: Reduces dimensions (downsamples)
        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),

        # Second Convolutional Layer: Extracts more complex features
        # 64 filters, each 3x3.

**Explanation of the Code:**

*   `Sequential` creates a linear stack of layers.
*   `Conv2D` layers perform convolution to learn features. Key parameters include the number of filters, kernel size, activation function, and `input_shape` (only for the very first layer).
*   `MaxPooling2D` layers perform max pooling to reduce spatial dimensions.
*   `Flatten` converts the multi-dimensional output from the convolutional/pooling part into a 1D vector suitable for Dense layers.
*   `Dense` layers are standard fully connected neural network layers. The final layer uses `softmax` activation for multi-class probability outputs.
*   `model.compile` configures the learning process, specifying how the model should be updated (optimizer), how to measure error (loss), and what performance metric to track (e.g., accuracy).

## Beyond the Basics: Common CNN Architectures

The concepts discussed form the building blocks for many influential CNN architectures developed by researchers. These architectures often introduce innovations to improve performance, efficiency, or the ability to train deeper networks. Here are a few notable examples (from a high level):

*   **AlexNet (2012):** A pioneering deep CNN that significantly advanced image classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, popularizing CNNs. It used techniques like ReLU activation and dropout.
*   **VGGNet (2014):** Known for its simplicity and depth, primarily using small 3x3 convolutional filters stacked consecutively. Showed that depth was crucial for performance.
*   **GoogLeNet / Inception (2014):** Introduced "Inception modules," which performed convolutions with multiple filter sizes (1x1, 3x3, 5x5) in parallel within the same layer, capturing features at different scales efficiently.
*   **ResNet (Residual Network) (2015):** Enabled the training of extremely deep networks (over 100 layers) by introducing "skip connections" or residual blocks, which helped mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.
*   **ZFNet (2013):** An improvement on AlexNet, particularly known for its use of visualization techniques to understand the features learned by different layers of the network.

These architectures represent significant milestones and demonstrate how the fundamental CNN principles can be extended and adapted for complex computer vision tasks.

## Conclusion (formerly Summary)

Convolutional Neural Networks provide a powerful framework for image recognition. By sequentially applying layers for **Convolution** (feature detection), **Pooling** (downsampling), **Flattening** (vectorization), and **Full Connection** (classification), CNNs automatically learn hierarchical visual features directly from data. Understanding these building blocks is key to using and designing CNNs effectively.

**Final Note:**

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** is typically used for **spatial** data, such as images. It’s great for recognizing patterns in **static** data, like textures, shapes, and structures in images or even spatial relationships in other types of structured data.
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)** is designed for **sequential** data, meaning it processes information **over time**. It’s often used for things like time-series prediction, natural language processing, and speech recognition, where understanding previous steps influences the next ones.
